# Garden Tools
A prototype for a set of tools to help the home gardener and orchardist.

## Disclaimer
At the moment, this is primarily a learning project to help work out and practice bit of code that could be useful in my day-to-day job.  If something useful for tracking or managing a hoem garden come out of this, that would be nice.  It isn't the main goal.

This may be a toy project, but for it to be a useful learning experience, I need to reat this as if it was a real project for a client.

## Problem to Solve
Maintiaining a garden (or home orchard) is involves a number of steps and tasks.  To achieve the best results inputs and outputs need to be tracked.

Inputs might include
* Ferilizers
* Seed or Cultivar used

Outputs might include 
* Yields
* Quality
* Ripening times
* Plant Material
